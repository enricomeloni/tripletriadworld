A triple triad webapp in javascript and html

Triple Triad is a Collectable Card Game which made its debut in Final Fantasy 8. This is a remake in form of a webapp with 
vanilla javascript and html.

This webapp was developed for a university project and while the games are playable, there is no artificial intelligence 
that makes a game worth playing. Future developments will consist in rewriting the game as a C# app with online matches

Matches will be logged and used to train a neural network, to create an AI that plays against the player.
